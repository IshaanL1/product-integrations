## How Web Unblocker work

Web Unblocker uses a simple backconnect proxy (a single-entry node) and is compatible with your existing code.
If you have already utilized proxies in your infrastructure, all you need to do is type in a Web Unblocker entry node
instead of your current one. Thatâ€™s it. Visit [Oxylabs documentation](https://developers.oxylabs.io/advanced-proxy-solutions/web-unblocker) for further guidelines.
